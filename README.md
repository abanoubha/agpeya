 Agpeya: Prayer Book of Hours. This app is inspired by [Agpeya by Armia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coptsonline.agpeya).

 Download Agpeya app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softwarepharaoh.agpeya).

## Why opensource ?

I created the app to be available to all people who need it, all the time, everywhere. I'd like to create a developer community to maintain the app indefinitely.
